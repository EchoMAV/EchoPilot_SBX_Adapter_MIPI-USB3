This is an open-source payload/camera adapter for a 4-lane MIPI camera and an optional FLIR boson in conjunction with OEM Camera VPC3 board (https://www.oemcameras.com/rhp-bos-vpc3-if.htm?search=vpc). The board also includes a 100Mbps Ethernet port using a JST GH connector.

6 Layer PCB, 4/4 mil spacing, min hole size is 0.2mm
Note impedance controlled traces for MIPI, USB and Ethernet. Trace width and spacing may need to be adjusted depending on the stackup and materials used in production.
